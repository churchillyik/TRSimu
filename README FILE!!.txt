2) INTRODUCTION
**********************************************

I'm glad we finnaly released one of best Travian clone versions made. There has been lots of people talking
bad things about me (Dzoki). Well where to start. It al started somewhere around November 2010. I was
registered on forums made by Elmar and G3n3s!s. Their project was going well. I almost bought Elmars's
R4 but i realised that TopErwin is actually doing better releases than Elmar so I decided not to buy R4
but to stay on better, free one.

Later TopErwin and I made some kind of community. Well he was bored so he stopped working on it and I didnt
have much knowlege and or time to do it alone. Than i made small repack with lots of fixes. That was later
my TravianCloneProject v1.0.0. I was looking for some teammates, but hard to find. G3n3s!s joined me, so as
SlimShady and later Dixie and some guys that were working just few days with me.

SlimShady suddenly stopped working on it, G3n3s!s kinda dissapeared so it was just me and Dixie (as known
as Marvin on RageZone). We didnt stop. Dixie is far best coder i know, he had hes own Travian T2 community
called TravianX.nl. So I got good idea. Lets make TravianX.nl community now T3.6 version and lets finish
this script together. Fuck yeah, that was bussines of the year, but then *buf*. School. What to say, everyone
was expecting v2.0.0 so fast done. I just promised something I couldnt realize in that short time. I feel
really sorry I made you all wait almost 3 months. I AM SORRY! But that is real life guys. The point is no
one ever managed to finish reinforcements and catapults and more more things. Chiefing, more major bugs.
We actually made script so good you can play like on normal Travian.

After that I lost my internet connection, indeed I'm writing this readme file on my PC while I still dont
have internet connection. I read some posts on RageZone. Hamster2, dawe007, those are guys that are jelaous
on what we made. We made best release so far, and we released it for FREE. Let me repeat, FREE. We try to 
leave it free but we cant without small donations, we need that money for domain and host.

Later i saw some comments like: 'you did nothing, elmar did, akakori did.' Lets clear this out. Travian
Clone script, that one that you are using is made by almost 100-200 people. Everyone added something.

Yes you are right. Akakori did the base of game, he almost did most of the job. Elmar did some shitty
battle, so buggy, we just fixed it up. TopErwin did best job really. He was fixing battle and adding
some vital things into game. But where are they? Tell me that. Where are they? They dissapeared with your
money, they stopped working on it, they dont give a fuck about this script. The point of this 3500 symbol
letter is that WE ARE FINISHING THIS SCRIPT, slowly but we are. We did most of the job. We fixed so much
small but annoing bugs. We did it, not them, they left. They just turned of MSN, or Skype or told you they
stopped. But we didnt, and we wount!

Travian fucked us up with TravianX but we will set up new web site.

Now when you know my story and my name, now shit on me, and post spammy flaming comments on my releases.
Im doing my best, dont like it? Stop downloading my "shit".

With respect,
Dzoki
